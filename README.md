compatibility:
  linux works just fine, i havent tested it on windows but it hopefully should work there, and i have no clue about macOS

controls:
  use the 'WASD' keys to move your mouse
  the 'q' key left clicks
  the 'e' key right clicks
  (you can hold 'q' and 'e' to hold your click)
  (please note that i suck at coding, so clicking might feel weird in some cases)

how to install:
  make sure you have python 3.x.x in your device
  install the modules keyboard, time, and pyautogui
  run funny-mouse.py as admin/root
  ta-daaaa!!
